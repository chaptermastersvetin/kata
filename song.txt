[Intro]
I am Iron Man

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves, will he fall?

[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl
